        <p style="margin-top:8%; padding-left:20px">In my free time, I love learning about the stock market and doing my own comprehensive research or trading.
        I started trading in the market when I was sixteen years old and did not have much financial knowledge. 
        Because of the rocky market situations and the lack of education, I lost over fifteen thousand dollars 
        because of option contracts. I am now eighteen years old and down sixteen thousand dollars. Life is good :D

            This is TAMID, the best organization on planet Earth. In TAMID, we have three tracks that students can join. This includes Investment Fund, Tech Consulting, and Consulting. 
            To access each track, students have to go through respective prerequisite courses, IFC, TCF, and general education. Every new member has to go through thier general education 
            course but not everyone has to take the other two courses(unless they want to get into Investment Fund or Tech Consulting). I am currently a part of all three prerequisite courses 
            and would like to challenge myself by attempting to be both a developer for Tech consulting and and analyst for Investment Fund.
